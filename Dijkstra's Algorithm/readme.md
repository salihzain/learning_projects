# Mapping Project



## Task

This project will require you to create a rudimentary mapping program in Java. Given a data set representing the roads and intersections in a speciÔ¨Åc geographic region, your program should be able to plot a map of the data and provide shortest path directions between any two arbitrary intersections.



## How to run the program 

There are three maps to choose from: ur.txt, monroe.txt, nys.txt. Select one of the maps, select any two arbitrary points. In the command line, do the following: 

`javac *.java`

Then, you have three choices: 

1. Get the direction from a starting point to an end point, in this case, run the following command: `java StreetMap map_name.txt --directions starting_point destination_point` for example, `java StreetMap ur.txt --directions LOVEJOY SIMON`
2. Get the direction and view a map of the directions, in this case, run the following command: `java StreetMap map_name.txt --show --directions starting_point destination_point` for example `java StreetMap ur.txt --show --directions LOVEJOY SIMON`
3. View a single map only without getting directions between two points. in this case, run the following command: `java StreetMap map_name.txt --show` for example, `java StreetMap ur.txt --show`



## Implementation 

First of all, let's think about we need to do in steps. 

1. I take a text file as input. Every line of the text file is formatted as one of the following two ways:
   1. `i intersection_name latitude longtitude` for intersections 
   2. `r road_name from_intersection to_intersection` for roads 
2. I create an object of our implementation of directed graph and we add all the vertices first, then the edges. 
3. Based on the command in the input, I do the following: 
   1. if the command is `--directions` then I  take a starting point and a destination point. I create an object of ShortestPath that runs Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths to all the connected intersections. Then I find the path to the destination point, print the total distance, and the directions from the starting point to the destination point. 
   2. if the command is `--show` then I just render a graphical representation of the map using java graphics. 
   3. if the command is `--show --directions` then I do 1 & 2 in their order. I also graph the path between the starting point and the destination point in blue. 

### Classes 

In this project, I apply the MVC (model, view, controller) principle of programming. I divide the classes into these three categories to ensure clarity and readability as well as efficiency. 

In general, we have the classes below: 

| Model        | View | Controller |
| ------------ | ---- | ---------- |
| Graph        | View | StreetMap  |
| Vertex       |      |            |
| Edge         |      |            |
| ShortestPath |      |            |

I'm  also using In.java as a helper library to read the input. The appropriate citation to the authors was stated at the bottom In.java file. 

I will dive into the details of every class. I would like to clarify that the ideas behind the Graph data structure implementation as well as the Dijaktra's algorithm (i.e. ShortestPath) were inspired by the ideas presented in

### Expected Total Runtime

The expected total runtime will be given using the worst case scenario. In this case, using nys.txt (New York State) as the input map. There are three test cases depending on the three different possible commands:

1. `--show` ‚â§ 10 seconds 

2. `--directions` from *i0* (almost east-most point) to *i50236* (west-most) -- worst case ‚â§  35 seconds 
3. `--show --directions` for the second case -- worst case ‚â§  35 seconds



### Test Cases

We tried our program by running test cases for each map using different inputs. We wanted to see if the our program is returning the expected output or not. Below are our test cases which all passed. 

1. ur.txt
