# Huffman Coding 

This project implements Huffman coding algorithm to compress any text or binary files. 

It works great for text files, not so much for binary files like images or so. 

To run the program, do the following in the command line:

`javac *.java`

`java huffmanSubmit`

Then follow the directions :)
