# CSC 242: Project 1



## Project info:

A  simple implementation of Connect Four game using  state space search algorithm: `MiniMax` along few of its variations such as `H-MiniMax`. 

The code is based on ideas presented in the book, **Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach**. Check the book here: http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu

If you don't know what Connect Four is, read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four

It's very similar to tic-tac-toe, so you can do a few edits to my code and design a tic-tac-toe game. If you get stuck on that, let me know, and I would love to help. 



## Included files:

```
State.java
Board.java
Action.java
Minimax.java
Game.java
```



## Building the project 

Use `javac *.java` in your terminal to build the project. 



## Running the project

Use `java Game`in your terminal to run the project. 



## Note

The agent plays best around depth 11 or 12.
