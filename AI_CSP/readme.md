## Project info:
Implementation of CSP Algorithm and applying the algorithm to solve three well-know problems: Australia map coloring, Job scheduling, and NQueen problem. 
The implementation is generic enough such that any problem that can be formalized as CSP can be solved using this implementation (if the constraints were already implemented. Otherwise, it's easy to implement a new type of constraints). 

## Included Packages and Classes:

```
Core:
	- Constraint
	- CSP 
	- Variable
Solver: 
	- Assignment
	- Solver 
AusturaliaCSP: 
	- AustraliaCSP
	- AustraliaDomain
	- NotEqualConstraint
JobCSP
	- JobCSP

	- PrecedenceConstraint
	- DisjunctiveConstraint

NQueenCSP 
	- NQueenCSP
	- NQueenDomain
	- NotAttackingConstraint
	- Pair
```
